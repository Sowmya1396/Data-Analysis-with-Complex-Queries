----In this we learn about how to write data analysis with complex queries
----CTES, Window Functions and Subqueries

* What is CTE?
  A CTE (Common Table Expression) is a temporary result set in SQL that you can refer to within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
  It simplifies complex queries, improves readability, and can be used recursively.

Syntax
WITH CTE_name (column1, column2, ...)
AS (
    SELECT statement
)
SELECT *
FROM CTE_name

* What are window functions in Sql?
  Window functions in SQL are special functions that perform calculations across a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row — this set of rows is called a window.

  Unlike regular aggregate functions (like SUM, AVG, COUNT) that collapse rows into a single result, window functions keep each row and add extra information to it.
Syntax
function_name(...) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY ...]
    [ORDER BY ...]
)

* What are subqueries in sql?
A subquery in SQL is a query inside another query — like a mini-question that helps answer a bigger question.
OR
A subquery in SQL, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query placed inside another SQL statement.

Example:
SELECT employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (
  SELECT department_id
  FROM departments
  WHERE department_name = 'Sales'
);

NOW LET'S SEE HOW TO USE A ADVANCED DATA ANALYSIS
This report analyzes sales data to identify REGIONAL SALES using advanced SQL techniques. The analysis uses a combination of window functions, CTEs, and subqueries to provide actionable insights.

WITH RegionalSales AS (
  SELECT region, AVG(sales_amount) AS avg_sales
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY region
),
CompanyAverage AS (
  SELECT AVG(avg_sales) AS company_avg
  FROM RegionalSales
)
SELECT
  r.region,
  r.avg_sales,
  c.company_avg,
  r.avg_sales - c.company_avg AS diff_from_avg
FROM RegionalSales r
CROSS JOIN CompanyAverage c;
